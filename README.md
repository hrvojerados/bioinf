This project was made as a part of bioinformatics course "Bioinformatika 1" at Faculty of Electrical Engeneering and Computing, University of Zagreb
under the mentorship of Assoc. prof. PhD Mirjana Domazet-Lo≈°o.

We used a hash function called "BOBHash" implemented on: https://github.com/wanghanchengchn/bamboofilters/tree/main/src/common
