# Info
This project was made as a part of bioinformatics course "Bioinformatika 1" at Faculty of Electrical Engeneering and Computing, University of Zagreb
under the mentorship of Assoc. prof. PhD Mirjana Domazet-Lo≈°o.

We used a hash function called "BOBHash" implemented on: https://github.com/wanghanchengchn/bamboofilters/tree/main/src/common

We used "small_vector" data structure from Boost library.

We used *E. coli* genome for generating test cases from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000005845.2/

This software is open for others to use as per MIT license.
